Having spent several years preparing to become a doctor, deciding to pivot to an entirely different career field was not easy for me. However, I told myself that the best case scenario of completing the boot camp is that I will find a career that is both exciting and challenging for me and the worst case scenario is that I learn a new skill.</p><p>As a recent graduate of the program, I can confidently say that this is the career I want to pursue and I know I can make an impact in!</p>")

As a woman who worked in healthcare and now trying to enter the tech industry, working in a highly diverse and inclusive work culture is my top priority. I am truly excited to hear that Facebook also ensures that inclusivity is a priority.<p><h5>My educational background</h5><p>Having a background in human research and human behavior, I will bring a novel approach to building products at Facebook, a platform geared toward social interaction. I have taken numerous courses on psychology and neurobiology of how human brain functions in response to technology.
